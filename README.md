This repository contains various projects focused on Generative AI, which is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves creating models capable of generating new content. These projects explore different aspects of generative models, including text generation, image synthesis, and more.

Generative AI projects involve creating and fine-tuning models to generate new content like text, images, and audio. These projects often use large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, BERT, and llama for text generation, translation, and summarization, with fine-tuning applied to tailor the models for specific tasks or domains. They also explore image generation using GANs and diffusion models, with applications in creative content, interactive systems, and data augmentation.
